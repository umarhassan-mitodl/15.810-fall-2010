### Discussion Questions

1.  Evaluate current strategic position and the options available to Sonance.
2.  Which option should Sonance pursue: develop and promote the ultra-luxury Architectural Series? Focus on basic in-wall speakers for production home developers and sell directly to the builders? Continue to pursue growth through the direct-to-consumer retail strategy?
3.  What should Ari Supran do to generate profitable and sustainable growth for the company and sales momentum for Sonance's products? Should he change Sonance's marketing strategy to target consumers directly? Target the developers of production home developments? Target architects and interior designers designing custom homes? Try to win back the high-end custom installers Sonance had lost under the previous management?
